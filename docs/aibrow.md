# AiBrow

## Uninstall

If you want to remove models, the easiest way is to click on the AiBrow extension in the top-right of Chrome, then under the models section remove the ones you no longer want.

If you want to remove the helper and models completely, removing its data directory will do this. It's located at

```
macOS ~/Library/Application Support/Axonzeta/AiBrow
Windows ~/AppData/Local/Axonzeta/AiBrow
Linux `~/.config/Axonzeta/AiBrow
```
