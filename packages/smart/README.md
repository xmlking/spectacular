## Writing Assistance

The **summarizer** API produces summaries of input text;
The **writer** API writes new material, given a writing task prompt;
The **rewriter** API transforms and rephrases input text in the requested ways.

### Use cases

Based on discussions with web developers, we've been made aware so far of the following use cases:

#### Summarizer API

* Summarizing a meeting transcript for those joining the meeting late.
* Summarizing support conversations for input into a database.
* Giving a sentence- or paragraph-sized summary of many product reviews.
* Summarizing long posts or articles for the reader, to let the reader judge whether to read the whole article.
* Generating article titles (a very specific form of summary).
* Summarizing questions on Q&A sites so that experts can scan through many summaries to find ones they are well-suited to answer.

#### Writer API

* Generating textual explanations of structured data (e.g. poll results over time, bug counts by product, â€¦)
* Expanding pro/con lists into full reviews.
* Generating author biographies based on background information (e.g., from a CV or previous-works list).
* Break through writer's block and make creating blog articles less intimidating by generating a first draft based on stream-of-thought or bullet point inputs.
* Composing a post about a product for sharing on social media, based on either the user's review or the general product description.

#### Rewriter API

* Removing redundancies or less-important information in order to fit into a word limit.
* Increasing or lowering the formality of a message to suit the intended audience.
* Suggest rephrasing of reviews or posts to be more constructive, when they're found to be using toxic language.
* Rephrasing a post or article to use simpler words and concepts ("[explain like I'm 5](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ELI5)").

## TODO

* [Smart Datetime Picker](https://dub.co/blog/smart-datetime-picker) with [Chrono](https://git.new/chrono)
* [midday-ai](https://github.com/midday-ai/midday) for smart filters idea.
