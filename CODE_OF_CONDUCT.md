# Contributor Code of Conduct

This project adheres to [The Code Manifesto](http://codemanifesto.com)
as its guidelines for contributor interactions.

## The Code Manifesto

We want to work in an ecosystem that empowers developers to reach their
potential — one that encourages growth and effective collaboration. A space
that is safe for all.

A space such as this benefits everyone that participates in it. It encourages
new developers to enter our field. It is through discussion and collaboration
that we grow, and through growth that we improve.

In the effort to create such a place, we hold to these values:

- **Discrimination limits us.** This includes discrimination on the basis of
  race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, nationality,
  technology and any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people.

- **Boundaries honor us.** Your comfort levels are not everyone’s comfort
  levels. Remember that, and if brought to your attention, heed it.

- **We are our biggest assets.** None of us were born masters of our trade.
  Each of us has been helped along the way. Return that favor, when and where
  you can.

- **We are resources for the future.** As an extension of #3, share what you
  know. Make yourself a resource to help those that come after you.

- **Respect defines us.** Treat others as you wish to be treated. Make your
  discussions, criticisms and debates from a position of respectfulness. Ask
  yourself, is it true? Is it necessary? Is it constructive? Anything less is
  unacceptable.

- **Reactions require grace.** Angry responses are valid, but abusive language
  and vindictive actions are toxic. When something happens that offends you,
  handle it assertively, but be respectful. Escalate reasonably, and try to
  allow the offender an opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly
  correct the issue.

- **Opinions are just that: opinions.** Each and every one of us, due to our
  background and upbringing, have varying opinions. That is perfectly
  acceptable. Remember this: if you respect your own opinions, you should
  respect the opinions of others.

- **To err is human.** You might not intend it, but mistakes do happen and
  contribute to build experience. Tolerate honest mistakes, and don't
  hesitate to apologize if you make one yourself.
