Astro comes with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) support out of the box. This example showcases how to style your Astro project with Tailwind.

For complete setup instructions, please see our [Tailwind Integration Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

```shell
turbo dev  --filter=web
turbo dev  --filter=web --  --verbose
```

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                    | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
